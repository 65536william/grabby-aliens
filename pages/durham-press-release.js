          A team of scientists believe ‘grabby aliens’ are needed to explain why
          we humans have appeared so soon after the big bang, and that our
          descendants could encounter them in roughly a billion years’ time.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          To calculate such numbers, four researchers, led by Professor Robin
          Hanson from George Mason University, USA, and including a Durham
          University PHD student, have built a simple model. A model they say is
          far more than just speculation, as all its parameters are set by
          relevant cosmological data. In particular: the current age of the
          universe, the fact we humans have yet to see aliens in our sky, and
          the timing of key events in Earth’s history.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          The research can be read in full in their paper, accepted for
          publication in the{" "}
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01522">Astrophysical Journal</a>.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          Durham University PhD student Daniel Martin, a co-author who helped to
          illustrate the model, said: “We think there are other civilisations
          within the universe that have developed more than humans, and the only
          reason they do not appear in our sky is because their light has not
          yet reached us.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          “My illustration of this model shows many cones within a particular
          area of the universe. Each cone represents one civilisation, which
          expands rapidly in space until it meets others.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          “Perhaps only a very few intelligent civilizations can survive for a
          long period of time or will choose to expand rapidly. But our model
          says that those few exceptions will eventually fill and remake the
          universe. A once lifeless universe will soon be filled with
          intelligent life.”
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          They estimate that such aliens appear once per million galaxies, that
          they now occupy about half the space in the universe, and that our
          descendants would encounter them in roughly a billion years.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          Lead researcher Professor Robin Hanson added: “I called these
          civilisations ‘grabby aliens’ because they last long, expand fast, and
          change the spaces they enter to meet their needs.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          “But this doesn’t mean that such civilizations are aggressive and
          fight when they meet. Our analysis actually doesn’t say what happens
          if these ‘grabby’ civilisations were to meet another.”
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          The team states the existence of grabby aliens provides an answer to
          the puzzle of why humans have appeared so soon after the big bang.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          They continue to explain that while our current date is late compared
          to when most stars formed, it is early considering how long most stars
          will last. The team believe we are even earlier when you consider the
          simple statistical model introduced in the 1980s by the physicist
          Brandon Carter, that describes what happens when a number of difficult
          stages (hard steps) must be endured before civilization can appear on
          a planet.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          Earth has overcome those hard steps long before when a typical
          civilization would, if the universe would sit and wait empty for such
          civilizations to appear.
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          Daniel added: “Our hypothesis offers an explanation as to why humans
          have evolved so quickly. If ‘grabby aliens’ will at some point occupy
          all of the universe, it&apos;s like a deadline had been set for human
          civilisation to appear, if it&apos;s not to arrive within a
          grabby-controlled environment.”
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-xl sm:text-lg text-base">
          Robin added: “Our account says that if humanity kills itself, that
          thankfully isn’t the end of life and civilization in the universe. But
          our account does suggest an aspiration for humanity: if we can avoid
          extinction, then we can expect to eventually meet and learn of
          hundreds of grabby civilizations. Let us work so that, when they learn
          of us, they will find something about us worthy of admiration and
          emulation.”
